# ansible-role-gridsite
A role to supervise a computing grid cluster. For now very tuned toward WLCG/IPHC site.

FIXME: I'm really not sure of the propper way to organize data, between this role, host_vars, group_vars and this place.
For now, many things will be put here, but may move in an ansible-gridsite main repository at some point.

- FIXME: yum, fetch-crl
